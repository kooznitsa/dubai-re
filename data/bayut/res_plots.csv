The Jebel Ali Port is located there. Al Maktoum International Airport has been constructed just outside the port area. Jebel Ali is connected to Dubai via the UAE Exchange (formerly Jebel Ali), Danube (formerly Jebel Ali Industrial) and Energy stations on the Dubai Metro. Among the infrastructure projects built to support the port and town is the world's largest desalination plant, the Jebel Ali , providing an ample supply of freshwater. Many Arab historians argue that it was named after Ali, who was the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad while expanding the Islamic Caliphate had stood on one hill and looked towards the sea and perhaps known as well although no such recorded proof has been found. ""Jebel"" means Mountain in Arabic On 23 September 1983, Gulf Air Flight 771 crashed in Jebel Ali killing all 112 people on board.

ABOUT JUMEIRAH PARKJumeirah Park is a project conceptualized and built by master developer Nakheel Properties. Launched in 2006 and completed in 2013, it is counted among the largest villa communities in Dubai linked on the map to JLT, The Meadows, and Jumeirah Village Triangle. The community is almost completely developed except for a few vacant residential plots. Moreover, the family-centric neighborhood is laced with jogging/bicycle tracks, children’s play areas, green parks, gyms, a community clubhouse, and sports courts. Jumeirah Park is a villa-only district, this means that each villa is detached. There are no attached villas or townhouses found in the area. With eight districts and over 2,000 deluxe standalone villas, this locality is expected to be home to a population of 10,000 residents. The property configurations for the detached houses in Jumeirah Park range from 3 to 5-bedroom residences. Most of the villas have two stories with bedrooms in the second story and the living room and dining hall on the ground. COMPANY PROFILEWe are so much more than a full-service real estate firm.
